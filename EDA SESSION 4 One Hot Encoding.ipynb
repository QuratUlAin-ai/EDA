Encoding is the technique we use to convert categorical entry in a dataset to a numerical data. Let say we have a dataset of employees in which there is a column that contains the information about the city location of an employee. Now we want to use this data to form a model which could predict the salary of an employee based upon his/her other details. Obviously, this model doesn’t understand anything about the city name. So how will you make the model know about it? For example, an employee who lives in a metropolitan city earns more than employees of a small city. Someway we need to make the model know about this .
